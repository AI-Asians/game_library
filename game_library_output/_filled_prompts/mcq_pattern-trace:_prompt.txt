# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Pattern-Trace**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* The player must trace or follow a specific pattern drawn on screen by clicking/tapping points in sequence
* Pattern should be clearly shown first as a guide, then fade partially to prompt the player to reproduce it
* Points or nodes should be visually distinct and show clear feedback when correctly traced
* The pattern should represent the correct answer to the MCQ question
* Incorrect patterns or wrong sequence tracing should provide immediate feedback
* Success requires tracing the pattern completely and accurately in the right order

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Pattern-tracing nodes should have a pixelated glow effect when activated
The path connecting nodes should appear as dashed pixel lines when shown as a guide
Use contrasting colors to make the pattern stand out against the background
Add subtle pixel animations for successful node connections

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

The pattern should be shown for 3 seconds at the start before fading
Players should be able to connect nodes in one continuous motion
Patterns should be simple enough to trace within the time limit but challenging enough to be engaging
Provide clear visual feedback for both correct and incorrect pattern tracing

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
