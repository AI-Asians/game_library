# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type TF.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 The Great Wall of China is visible from space.

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Mirror-Tap**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Two mirrored sets of options appear on opposite sides of the screen
* Player must tap the correct option on both sides simultaneously (or in very quick succession)
* The mirrored options should have visual symmetry but be identical in meaning
* There should be some visual indication when the player has successfully selected both matching options
* Success requires correctly identifying the true/false answer and tapping both mirrored representations

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

The mirrored options should have a symmetrical design with pixel borders
True/False options should be represented with distinctive pixel art icons (like checkmark vs X)
Include a pixelated mirror line or divide in the center of the screen
Use flickering or pulsing effects on the options in retro 8-bit style
Add a simple pixelated timer or progress bar to create urgency

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Add visual connection lines when player hovers over matching options
Include quick pixel animation when both sides are tapped correctly
Create a sense of urgency with a visible countdown timer
Make incorrect selections result in a quick game-over animation
Ensure the mirror effect is immediately intuitive to players

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
