**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 Which planet is known as the Red Planet?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: News-Headline:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* The question is presented like a breaking news headline with a flashy, news ticker-style animation
* Multiple choice answers appear as "news stories" below the headline
* Players must click/tap on the correct "news story" to answer
* Incorrect answers should appear as fake news stories with amusing headlines
* Incorporate news broadcast elements like a scrolling ticker at the bottom
* The overall feeling should mimic a news broadcast or newspaper interface
* Time pressure can be indicated with a "BREAKING NEWS" flashing element

---

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

* Use a TV-screen like frame around the game area to enhance the news broadcast feeling
* Include pixelated news anchor or newspaper-style layout
* News ticker should have a distinct retro LED appearance with blocky scrolling text
* "Breaking News" banner should flash in classic 8-bit animated style
* News stories should appear like pixelated newspaper clippings or TV broadcast lower thirds

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

* Include a brief "news jingle" sound at the beginning of the game
* The news ticker should scroll at a readable but urgent pace
* Clicking on an answer should trigger a news-appropriate response (correct = "confirmed report", incorrect = "fake news alert")
* Include a subtle countdown element styled as "LIVE" indicator that pulses with urgency
* News stories should be clearly selectable with obvious hover/touch feedback

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
