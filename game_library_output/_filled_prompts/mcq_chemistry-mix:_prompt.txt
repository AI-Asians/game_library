# UPDATED PROMPT

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 Which planet is known as the Red Planet?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Chemistry-Mix**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Player mixes elements/ingredients in a virtual lab setting
* Different answers are represented as chemical elements or compounds in beakers/containers
* Player drags and drops or combines ingredients into a central mixing container
* When the correct "formula" or answer is mixed, a successful reaction occurs
* Incorrect combinations cause failed reactions (smoke, bubbling, etc.)
* The mixing process should have visual feedback (color changes, particles, etc.)
* Success is determined by selecting and mixing the correct answer components

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Beakers and lab equipment should have a retro, pixelated appearance
 
Use bright, distinct colors for different elements/answers to make them visually distinct

Include bubbling or reaction animations that appear chunky and low-resolution

The central mixing container should have a distinct appearance from the ingredient containers

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Dragging elements should feel responsive and have immediate visual feedback

Successful chemical reactions should be visually rewarding (particles, color changes)

Failed reactions should provide clear but non-frustrating negative feedback

The mixing process should be simple enough to complete in a few seconds

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
