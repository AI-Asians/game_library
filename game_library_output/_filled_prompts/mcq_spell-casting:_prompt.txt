# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 Which planet is known as the Red Planet?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Spell-Casting:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Player must trace magical symbols/runes with mouse or finger to cast spells
* Correct spell patterns reveal or select the correct answer
* Symbols should glow or illuminate as the player traces them
* Show visual feedback when spells are cast correctly or incorrectly 
* Include magical particle effects that respond to player's tracing movements
* Each answer option should be associated with a unique spell pattern to trace

---

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Magic spells should have distinct 8-bit style particle effects when successfully cast
Spell patterns should appear as glowing runes with a pixelated appearance
Include a magical "wand" cursor that leaves a temporary trail as players trace patterns
Use color shifts to indicate correct/incorrect spell casting attempts
Magic circles and symbols should have a distinct retro "magical" appearance

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Spell patterns should be simple enough to trace in just a few seconds
Provide clear visual guidance for where to start and end each pattern
Magic effects should feel responsive and immediate to player's tracing actions
Include a brief visual tutorial showing how to trace the first pattern
Spell casting should have a satisfying magical "payoff" when completed correctly

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
