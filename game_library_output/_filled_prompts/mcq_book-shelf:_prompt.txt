# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Book-Shelf**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Books on a shelf contain different answers - player must pull out the correct book
* Each book should have a different title/label representing possible answers
* Books should be arranged on a bookshelf with spines facing out
* Player clicks/taps on a book to select it and pull it from the shelf
* Visual feedback should show the book being pulled out when selected
* Clear indication of correct/incorrect selection after a book is chosen
* Books should have different colors or designs to make them visually distinct

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

The bookshelf should have a wooden texture with pixel-art details.
Books should have distinct pixelated designs and clearly visible titles.
Add dust particles or small pixel details when books are moved.
Include retro-style shadows and highlights on the books and shelf.

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Books should slide smoothly but with pixel-style movement when selected.
Include a subtle hint mechanism if the player doesn't make a selection within 5 seconds.
Add a small particle effect when the correct book is selected.

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
