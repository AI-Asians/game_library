# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Galaxy-Jump**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Player controls a character that must jump from platform to platform in a space/galaxy environment
* Each platform displays a possible answer to the MCQ question
* Player must navigate to and land on the platform with the correct answer
* Platforms may move or be positioned at different heights
* Incorrect platforms might disappear or break when landed on
* Visual space elements like stars, planets, or asteroids should be in the background
* Game ends when player either lands on correct platform or falls off screen

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Space theme with starry backgrounds, pixelated planets, and space elements
Character should be a simple astronaut or space-themed character
Platforms should look like small asteroids, satellites, or space stations
Use deep blues, purples, and bright accent colors typical of space-themed retro games

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Character should have smooth but simple jump mechanics with a small arc
Gravity should feel floaty to match the space theme
Platforms should be spaced at jumpable distances
Include simple visual feedback when landing on platforms
Character should not be able to double-jump
Game should have clear visual feedback for success/failure

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
