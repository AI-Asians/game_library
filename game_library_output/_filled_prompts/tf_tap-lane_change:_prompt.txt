# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type TF.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 The Great Wall of China is visible from space.

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Tap-Lane Change:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Player controls a character that moves between 2-3 lanes (left/right or up/down)
* True and False answers appear as obstacles in different lanes
* Player must navigate to the lane with the correct answer
* Obstacles move toward the player at increasing speed
* Player taps/clicks to change lanes and select their answer
* The game ends when the player collides with either a true or false obstacle

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

The character should appear as a pixelated runner or vehicle
Lane dividers should have a distinct 8-bit appearance
True/False obstacles should be clearly marked and visually distinct
Use high-contrast colors to ensure visibility of lanes and obstacles
Include simple particle effects when changing lanes or colliding with answers

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

The lane change movement should feel responsive and snappy
Obstacles should approach at a consistent, manageable speed that gives players time to react
Include a brief visual/audio cue when the player changes lanes
When collision occurs, provide clear feedback whether the answer was correct or incorrect
The question should remain visible throughout gameplay

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
