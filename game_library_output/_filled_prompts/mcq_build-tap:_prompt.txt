# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Build-Tap**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Player builds a structure or stacks elements by tapping at the right moment
* Elements move across the screen (horizontally or vertically) requiring precise timing to place them
* Each successful tap adds to the structure being built
* The goal is to build a complete structure that corresponds to the correct answer
* Player must make choices about which elements to place to form the correct answer
* Missing a tap or placing an incorrect element may result in an unstable structure

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Building blocks should have a pixelated appearance with clear outlines
Use contrasting colors for different answer blocks to make them visually distinct
Include retro-style particle effects when blocks are placed successfully
Add simple grid or alignment guides to help players see where blocks will land

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Building elements should move at a moderate pace - not too fast to be unfair, but quick enough to be challenging
Include a visual indicator for the optimal timing of taps
Provide immediate visual feedback when blocks are placed (both correct and incorrect placements)
Allow for slight timing errors but reward perfect placement

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
