# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Shape-Sort Tap:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Different shapes or objects appear on screen, each containing a different answer option
* Shapes should have distinct colors and be clearly different from each other (circles, squares, triangles, etc.)
* Players must tap/click on the shape containing the correct answer
* Shapes may move around the screen in simple patterns to add challenge
* When a shape is tapped, provide immediate visual feedback (glow, pulse, or change color)
* The correct shape should have a distinct visual attribute but not obvious enough to make the answer trivial

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Shapes should have a pixelated appearance with jagged edges rather than smooth curves.

Use high-contrast colors for better visibility of the shapes against the background.

Add simple pixel-style particle effects when shapes are clicked.

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Shapes should move at a moderate pace - not too fast to cause frustration, but not too slow to be boring.

Include subtle visual cues to draw attention to the shapes but without giving away the answer.

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
