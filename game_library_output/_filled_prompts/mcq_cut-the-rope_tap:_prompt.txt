# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 Which planet is known as the Red Planet?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Cut-The-Rope Tap:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Objects (representing different answers) are suspended by ropes/strings in the game area
* Player must tap/cut the rope holding the correct answer
* When cut, the objects should fall realistically (with gravity)
* Incorrect objects may have special behaviors when cut (e.g., explode, disappear, etc.)
* Success is achieved by cutting only the rope connected to the correct answer
* The rope-cutting mechanic should have satisfying visual feedback

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

The ropes should have a chunky, pixelated appearance.
The hanging objects should be distinct planet shapes with 8-bit style details.
When a rope is cut, add a small pixelated "snip" animation effect.
The falling motion should have exaggerated, chunky physics (not smooth).
Include a small pixel-art scissors cursor when hovering over ropes.

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

The rope-cutting mechanic should provide immediate feedback when clicked/tapped.
All ropes should be clearly visible and clickable.
Add a slight swinging motion to the hanging planets to make them feel more dynamic.
The correct answer (Mars) should be visually identical to other planets until the rope is cut.
If the wrong planet is cut, it should fall off-screen but also indicate it was incorrect.

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
