Here's the updated prompt:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Rhythm-Hit**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Targets or answer options move rhythmically across the screen in time with a beat
* Player must hit/click/tap targets at the right moment when they align with a specific area
* Include a "hit zone" or target area where answers should be clicked when they pass through
* Answers should move at a steady, predictable pace across the screen
* Visual feedback when the player correctly times their hit
* Include visual cues that help players anticipate when to hit (like approach lines)

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Include a beat indicator that flashes to the rhythm
Create a pixel-art "hit zone" that looks like a musical note or drum
Use chunky pixel animations when answers are hit correctly
Include subtle background elements that pulse with the rhythm
Use retro-styled "note highway" or track where answers move along

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Ensure the rhythm is clearly indicated through visual cues
The beat should be consistent and predictable
Include at least 4 possible answer options that move along the rhythm track
Make sure the hit timing window is generous enough for casual players
Provide immediate feedback on hits with both visual and audio cues

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
