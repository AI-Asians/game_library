# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

  ---

**GAME MECHANIC: Platform-Builder:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Player must build a path/platform to reach a goal by selecting correct answers
* Each correct answer places a platform piece that helps bridge a gap
* Incorrect answers cause platforms to crumble or not appear
* The character can only progress by building the correct path
* A character must navigate across these platforms to reach the end goal/treasure
* Visual indication should show where platforms will appear if correct answers are chosen

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Platform pieces should have a distinct retro pixel art style with visible texture
Character should be a simple but charming 8-bit design with basic walking animation
The background should feature a pixel-art scene with parallax scrolling if possible
Platforms should visibly materialize or crumble with chunky pixel animations
Include pixel-art goal/flag element at the end of the path

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Character should move automatically forward when possible
Players should only need to select answers, not control character movement
The gap/platform structure should be clearly visible from the start
There should be visual cues indicating where the correct platform will appear
Incorrect answers should have immediate visual feedback (platform crumbling or not appearing)

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
