**UPDATED PROMPT:**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Mine-Sweeper Select:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Grid of tiles where one tile contains the correct answer and others contain wrong answers or "mines"
* Player must click/tap on the tile they believe contains the correct answer
* Selecting the correct answer results in a win
* Selecting an incorrect answer (mine) results in a loss
* All tiles start face down and reveal their content when selected
* Include visual indicators to distinguish between correct answers and mines
* The grid layout should be simple and clear (3x3 or 4x4)
* Use pixel-art style icons or symbols to represent mines and the correct answer

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

The tiles should have pixelated borders and a distinctive "unopened" texture.
When tiles are revealed, use simple pixel-art animations for explosions (mines) or victory effects.
Include retro-style cursor/selection indicators when hovering over tiles.
Use classic minesweeper color indicators or symbols with an 8-bit aesthetic.

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

The grid should be randomized so the correct answer appears in different positions on restart.
Ensure the tiles are large enough for easy selection on both mobile and desktop.
Add visual cues to indicate that tiles are interactive (slight animation on hover).
Keep the game's pacing quick - tiles should reveal instantly when clicked.

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
