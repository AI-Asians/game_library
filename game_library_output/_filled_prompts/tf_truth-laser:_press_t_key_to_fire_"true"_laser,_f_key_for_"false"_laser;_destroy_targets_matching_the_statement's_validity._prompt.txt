**UPDATED PROMPT:**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type TF.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 The Great Wall of China is visible from space.

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Truth-Laser: Press T key to fire "True" laser, F key for "False" laser; destroy targets matching the statement's validity.**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Player controls a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen
* Targets (with True/False designations) move across the screen
* Player must identify whether the statement is true or false
* Press T key to fire "True" laser beam, F key to fire "False" laser beam
* Player must hit targets that match the statement's validity (true targets if statement is true, false targets if statement is false)
* When correct targets are hit, they explode/disappear with retro pixel effects
* Game ends when player hits the correct type of target

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

The laser cannon should be a simple pixelated turret design
Laser beams should have a distinctive color (bright red for "True", blue for "False")
Targets should be clearly labeled with "T" or "F" in an 8-bit style
Explosions should use chunky pixel particles
Background should have a space/sci-fi theme with a grid or stars

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

The laser should have a short cooldown between shots
Targets should move at variable speeds for challenge
Clear visual feedback when laser hits targets (explosion animation)
Brief control instructions should appear on screen ("Press T for True, F for False")
Game should respond to both keyboard and touch input (tapping left/right sides of screen)

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
