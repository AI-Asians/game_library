# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

  ---

**GAME MECHANIC: Memory-Flash Tap:**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Answer options appear briefly and then disappear (flash on screen)
* Player must tap/click the correct option when it appears
* Options should appear in random locations on screen
* Each option should be visible for only a brief moment (0.5-2 seconds)
* Success depends on attentiveness and reaction time
* Incorrect options should also appear to create challenge

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Options should have a distinct "flash" effect when they appear and disappear
Use high-contrast colors to make flashing elements clearly visible
Include a subtle visual timer or countdown element that shows how long each option will remain visible
Add a simple visual indicator (like a pixelated spotlight or glow) to highlight where an option will appear next

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Each option should appear for progressively shorter durations to increase difficulty
Include a brief "pattern recognition" phase where options flash in a predictable sequence before becoming random
Ensure there's enough time delay between flashes to create a memory challenge
Add slight anticipation cues before an option appears (like a subtle glow or outline)

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
