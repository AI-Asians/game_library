# UPDATED PROMPT

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type MCQ.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 What is the capital of France?

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on web, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

**GAME MECHANIC: Bubble-Pop**  
 Description of mechanic: 

* Bubbles or balloons with different answer options float across the screen
* Player must click/tap the correct bubble to pop it
* Incorrect bubbles should be clearly distinguishable from the correct one
* Bubbles should move in an unpredictable or interesting pattern
* Success is achieved by accurately targeting and popping the bubble with the correct answer
* If player pops a wrong bubble, game should immediately indicate failure

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate "8-bit" feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

Bubbles should have a pixelated appearance with simple color fills and pixelated outlines.
Bubble popping animation should be a simple pixelated burst effect.
Use contrasting colors for different answer bubbles to make them easily distinguishable.
The background should be simple and not distract from the floating bubbles.

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

Bubbles should move at a moderate speed that creates challenge but isn't frustratingly fast.
Include at least 3-4 different answer options in bubbles.
Ensure bubbles don't overlap too much, allowing clear targeting.
Add subtle variation to bubble movement patterns to make gameplay engaging.

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on web.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
