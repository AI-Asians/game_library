**TASK:**

Replace the curly braces items with the values in the INFO\_DICT and replace the values enclosed within \<\<\< \>\>\> with the instructions enclosed within them (do not change anything else about the prompt). Note, your final output should be the UPDATED PROMPT, not code.

---

**INFO\_DICT:**

1. question\_type: MCQ  
2. example\_question:  What is the capital of France? 
3. device\_type: web  
4. game\_mechanic: Gardening-Select:  
5. game\_mechanic\_description: 
   ---

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Write code for an educational mini game made with HTML5 canvas featuring ONE QUESTION that is of type {question\_type}.  
 The game must start immediately in a playable state when loaded (no start screen).

No fancy game-over screen—only include a simple restart button without extra UI elements.

No complex UI beyond what's explicitly requested below.

Keep the code as simple and minimal as possible—minimize lines of code and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

---

**QUESTION**

Use exactly this ONE question in the game:  
 {example\_question}

Ensure the question does not overflow the screen.

---

**DEVICE OPTIMIZATION**

This game will be played on {device\_type}, so please ensure it is optimized and tested accordingly.  
 Fixed Canvas Size:

* For web: 800×600 pixels

* For mobile: 360×640 pixels

  ---

**GAME MECHANIC: {game\_mechanic}**  
 Description of mechanic: {game\_mechanic\_description}

There should be only one correct answer if the question is MCQ or T/F.

\<\<\<give clear bullet points for how the game mechanic should be shown in the game. For example, for the “rapid cycle” game mechanic, the bullet points would look like this: One or more slots rapidly cycle through different options/answers (like a slot machine)

Player must tap to stop the cycling at the correct moment when the right answer appears

Options should visibly rotate/cycle through a fixed position

There should be a clear visual indicator of what the correct answer is (a question or target)

Success is based on timing the tap/click precisely when the correct option is visible

---

**IMPORTANT STYLING & AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS**

Retro 8-bit Pixel Art style throughout (like classic NES/Game Boy).

All graphics should be pixelated, with a limited color palette (16–32 colors).

Animations should have a chunky, low-frame-rate “8-bit” feel.

UI elements must resemble an old-school arcade interface.

Do NOT use a pixel font. Use a simple, standard web-safe font (for example, Arial or sans-serif). Keep the font usage minimal, with no additional libraries required.

\<\<\<Add more styling and aesthetic requirements as needed for the {game\_mechanic}\>\>\>

---

**SOUND**

Let the model decide what retro-style sound effects to include, but use only a few simple beep-like effects (keep them minimal in code). No external sound libraries or large code snippets required.

---

**GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS**

Gameplay must be completable in UNDER 10 SECONDS.

No score-tracking of any kind. The game ends immediately as soon as the player hits the correct or incorrect answer.

Focus on ADDICTIVE, FUN timing with satisfying feedback.

No external dependencies—generate or simulate any needed sound effects in code with minimal overhead.

Simple enough for anyone to understand immediately with minimal instructions.

\<\<\<Add further gameplay requirements as needed for the {game\_mechanic}\>\>\>

---

**DELIVERABLE**

The code must be fully functional, efficient, and tested to work on {device\_type}.  
 The code must be kept as short as reasonably possible—avoid unnecessary lines.

Provide a single HTML file that is ready to run when downloaded and opened.
